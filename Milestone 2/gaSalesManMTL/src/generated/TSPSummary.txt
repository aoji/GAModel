This file summarizes the solution to a sample Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solved by the Genetic Algorithm (GA).

The Map for this TSP contains the following 5 cities:
	- Ottawa, at (0.0, 0.0)
	- Kingston, at (3.0, 1.0)
	- Montreal, at (5.0, 5.0)
	- Toronto, at (2.0, 8.0)
	- London, at (10.0, 10.0)

A TourOptimizer is used to generate and evolve the population of solutions. Each solution consists of a tour. 
A tour can be an IncompleteTour or a CompleteTour. An IncompleteTour includes some cities, while a CompleteTour includes all cities.

The TourOptimizer is associated with a population of 3 incomplete and 2 complete tours. These tours are as follows: 
	- Complete B1: Ottawa, London, Kingston, Toronto, Montreal
	- Incomplete A1: Ottawa, Toronto
	- Complete B2: Kingston, London, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto
	- Incomplete A2: Montreal, Kingston, London
	- Incomplete A3: Ottawa, Montreal, Kingston, Toronto, Ottawa

Finally, the fittest/best tour is A3, with a fitness of 0.7.
